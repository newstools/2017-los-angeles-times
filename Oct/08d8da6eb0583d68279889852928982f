It’s no shocker that international travel is far more expensive than domestic trips. But more than five times the cost? That’s the finding of the travel consumer website RewardExpert, which determined exactly how much Americans spend, and which states spend the most. In a study of 2016 spending habits released Tuesday, it found that a four-day domestic trip cost Americans $630 apiece, and they spent $3,538 on international travel.. Californians spent $721 domestically and $3,870 internationally, placing the state sixth among Western states. Alaskans spent more than those in another state, with $851 on U.S. travel and $4,779 on international trips. The high rate was linked to the state’s location and a less competitive marketplace for airfares.  Methodology: For its study, RewardExpert used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census for various years to estimate what Americans spent in 2016. For rate information, it used hotels.com, gasbuddy.com, data sets from the Department of Transportation and bus and train websites.travel@latimes.com ALSO:  Why you should apply for or renew your U.S. passport before January Heading up the 395?
